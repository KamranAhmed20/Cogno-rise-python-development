# Hangman Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. Players attempt to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. For every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: The game selects a random word from a predefined list.
- **Hangman Visualization**: A visual representation of the hangman figure is shown and updated with each incorrect guess.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the player's input is valid (single alphabetic character).
- **Win/Loss Conditions**: The player wins by guessing the word correctly or loses if the hangman is fully drawn.
- **Play Again Option**: After each game, the player is given the option to play another round.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: The game begins with a randomly selected word, represented by underscores.
2. **Guess Letters**: Input a letter to guess. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position(s). If not, a part of the hangman is drawn.
3. **Win or Lose**: The game ends when you either correctly guess the word or the hangman is completely drawn.
4. **Play Again**: After the game ends, you have the option to play again.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.

# Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of Python projects! This repository contains three practical applications:

1. **Hangman Game**
2. **Password Generator**
3. **Countdown Timer**

## Projects

### 1. Hangman Game

**Description**: 
A classic Hangman game implementation where the player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word. The game displays a hangman figure as incorrect guesses accumulate.

**Features**:
- Word list with randomly selected words.
- User input for guessing letters.
- Updates the display based on correct or incorrect guesses.
- Shows a hangman figure for incorrect guesses.
- Offers options to play again.

**How to Run**:
1. Save the `hangman_game.py` file to your local machine.
2. Execute the script using Python: `python hangman_game.py`.

**Code**: [hangman_game.py](hangman_game.py)

### 2. Password Generator

**Description**: 
A simple password generator that creates a random password based on user preferences. Users can specify the length and whether to include letters, digits, and symbols.

**Features**:
- Customizable password length.
- Options to include letters, digits, and symbols.
- Generates a random password based on user choices.

**How to Run**:
1. Save the `password_generator.py` file to your local machine.
2. Execute the script using Python: `python password_generator.py`.

**Code**: [password_generator.py](password_generator.py)

### 3. Countdown Timer

**Description**: 
A user-friendly countdown timer application using `tkinter` for the graphical interface. Allows users to set custom countdown durations and provides start, pause, and reset functionality.

**Features**:
- Input for custom countdown duration.
- Displays the remaining time in a user-friendly format.
- Start, pause, and reset controls.
- Visual feedback with a countdown display.

**How to Run**:
